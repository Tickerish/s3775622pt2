                Hello and welcome to my page, nice to meet ya.<br>
                So some basic information about me. I was first introduced to IT when I was at the age of 8 years old. When my mother first brought home a nintendo 64. This is when my interest in IT first developed. This being the need to solve puzzles and earn achievements to achieve a satisfaction feeling. This in turn evolved into wondering how stuff worked, like programs on a computer, how web pages went from one screen to another, how games and animation became so flawless. Basically I obtained a thirst, need and wonder about the IT world.

                This was further developed when I hit highschool and started studying IT in highschool, this was when I was first introduced to coding and ever since then, I've been enthralled with coding something and having it come out seemlessly. My IT experience is majorly lacking in the professional field however as I have not been able to obtain a job that will let me cultivate my skills even further, in the ever rapidly developing IT field. However I do have a degree in website development, so I know how to build a fully functioning website from scratch with a database included but the costs of hosting a website is a little beyond my means currently.

                I chose to come to RMIT due to the fact that it was the only university that I could find that would let me do a bachelor degree that would specialise in website development. I expect to learn a more indepth feel of website developement and also about the IT field in general. So I can be more knowledgeable and hopefully gain some first hand experience, whilst not feeling the pressure of being in an actual classroom where I feel like I'm the daftest person there.
