                <p class="pro-text">From the looks of it, it would seem that this kind of job would be the maintainence of the companies website. With the need to be able to evolve and adapt with the organisations needs. The skills call for knowledge with C# and demonstrated experience with HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, JSON and AJAX. Whilst I am none to familiar with these coding libraries, my willingness to learn, adapt and evolve on the spot, would come in handy. This job also calls for Well-developed oral and written communication skills, with the ability to work with people and collaborate effectively. As an inidivual I feel like I can fit that bill perfectly, with my experience in the retail field, I have dealt with all sorts of people and worked under all sorts of managers, from the lazy and negligent to the strict and proper.
                    <br><br>
                Now the skills and qualifications that I currently hold, would probably not land me the job as I am not too skilled with C#, nor JSON and AJAX. However I hope to grow more skilled and apt with these libraries to make my hirable skills that much more diveresed. I plan on obtaining these skills through rigouresly studying the languages that I can through this bachelor and abosrbing the information and growing as a developer. I will also be doing some side study if I find my current study load lacking.</p>
