                An interesting idea that I would think would really help the information technology community in general, and the gaming community is a game guide chatter bot. So, the idea would be a simple chat website where the user would ask a question like, how do I beat a boss and the game guide chatter bot would search the World Wide Web and find a guide that has the most activity on it, is the most recent and the most effective way and it would show the user this. Then if that way does not work, the user can come back and say it didn’t work and the chatterbot would go and bring up the second-best way to defeat a boss.

                This project would be both interesting and useful. As it would filter out a lot of the articles that are false, old or completely irrelevant, instead of finding every single page even associated with a single word. It would be like google but opposite in the same context. It would be targeting gamers of all ages and genders and identities, so there is a massive audience. If it gets large enough, gaming companies large and small could pay to gain advertising space on these websites/pages for their latest and upcoming game, so they can get some screen time and exposure. This project would be beneficial for both gamers and game industries.

                This project would be presented like a gui. Whether it be a website, or a downloadable search engine is yet to be determined. A website would have far more exposure to the general populace and would grow recognition through word of mouth and potential advertising of its own. However, this would be a non-for-profit search engine, or at least it would start of this way. Its home page would start of as a company logo and then a simple search bar. There would be options to refine the search that was wanted by platform or genre. This would be listed as a button, which would bring up a sort of drop-down table/menu where the user could select the specifications that the user would want.

            <p class="about">
                Then after they hit the search button, it would load into a new page, after going through the search parameters and it would return maybe 5 of the topmost options. If none of those options help the gamer beat, then they can go to the next 5, and so on so forth, until they finally beat what they are stuck on. It would be the google for gamers specifically. Specifically targeted towards them and for them. It would only return result correlating to games and game guides. Then when the user selects a guide or an article, it would take them directly to the page. This program would eliminate all the irrelevant data from the search parameters that has no literal or figurative association with anything to do with the game that is being searched, or what specific part of the game that is being searched.

                The software or hardware that would be required to use this program, would simply be a computer, internet connection, a monitor and some form of way to enter in data and some form of way to select an article. The languages that would be needed however is far more. From the basic stuff, such as HTML to the complex stuff like JavaScript, JQuery and or SQL.

                The only skills really required for this project to succeed is a knowledge of several different types of coding languages, an eye for user design and a skill for refining search parameters so the results can be returned within seconds if not milliseconds. It would be a project that would need constant updates, maintenance and refinements. It will be incredibly easy and simple to find the skills, software and hardware required for this project within this course. As everyone already has access to a computer of some kind and an internet connection to be able to complete the course. Finding the coding skills required is simple and easy enough within this class as there are a vast amount of coders and even those that do not know coding well, or at all, they are willing to learn and may yet as well have a keen eye for design. So it would be incredibly feasible to find the skills, software and hardware required for this project.

                The outcome of this project would be an elegant, refined, simple and smooth chatterbox/search engine with which gamers and those interested in gaming could use to help solve stuff that they cannot figure out. A draw back to this idea would be potential copyright claims from the authors of the guides. However, there shouldn’t be a need for copyright as it would be a not-for-profit search engine, with the same or very similar idea fuelling it as google does. Another potential drawback or problem would be the need to filter out false information or articles that were bound to result in failure.  The impact that this project would have would be small but would make a gamers life far simpler and less stressful for those that use the search engine.
